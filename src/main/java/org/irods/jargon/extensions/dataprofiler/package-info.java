/**
 * A recast of the older DataProfile, which represents a summary of a data
 * object or a collection and that maps general 'file' idoms like stars,
 * favorites, sharing, mime type, tags.
 * <p/>
 * While many implementations may differ, this package strives to bridge between
 * several known environments towards a common set of baseline attributes and
 * functions no matter how a thing like a star or a tag are stored in a target
 * implementation.
 * <p/>
 * The default representation will be oriented towards the new MetaLnx based
 * cloud browser.
