/**
 * Creates a handly little dot notation that can be used to access information
 * about iRODS. The api allows strings or enum values like 'data.size' that
 * access underlying iRODS data. This is used in metadata templates and would be
 * applicable to other situations where a little language is needed (like
 * templating)
