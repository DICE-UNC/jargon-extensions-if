# jargon-extensions-if
Generic interfaces for jargon extensions, including metadata templates and virtual collections.  

These generic interfaces have corresponding 'reference implementation' classes in jargon-extensions.  The reference implementations require only base iRODS, and other implementations may utilize external data stores, such as databases.
